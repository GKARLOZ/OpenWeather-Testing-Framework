Notes

Questions emerged during the creation of test cases. 

Notes..........................................................................

Question for later: 

1. A few test cases can be automated but I'm not sure if it should. Such as TC_LF_016, Wouldn't I need to create another test case to change the password to its original password to avoid having to change the password and use it on different test cases? 

How do companies handle test cases that can be automaized? How do dev test their code if it needs to be manually tested? 


When creating test, how do I know I covered the most importante? 
Should the first part of every testing step be in the prerequisites instead?for the registration page. 


Is it normal to have 27 test cases for a signin page?

Is it good practice to combine test cases when creating test scripts? For exmaples one test case validates the error message and another test cases validates the proper placeholder for text fields. Boths of them can be combined into one test script. 

Should the test scripts be exactly like the expected results in the test cases?

At some point, test scripts were not executing properly cus the website would not load. This stop happing until disconnecting and reconnecting to the internet. 


When testing the create account page, how do I know that all 3 check boxes present an  

Bugs Found ............................................................................


Bugs found while creating test cases: 

1.
Bug found in tester@gmail when registration
I thought the web application automacticlly might put the .com part but it does not. It creates a separate account for that person with different username.

2.
A taken username can be registered with a different email.

3. 
Username accepts spaces and not trimmed.

4. 
Password complexity is not complex enough. Only requirement is to have 8 character minimum. 

5. 
User should be loggout when pressing the logout button and than pressing the back button on broswer. 

6. 
When a person logouts from the profile page, and pressing the back button on the browser, sensitive information is still displayed. The same happens with any page such as the API keys and billing plans.  

7. 
Using spaces on search box displays unexpected search results. 

8. Not sure if this is a valid bug. 
A few odd naming cities and islands don't appear.
